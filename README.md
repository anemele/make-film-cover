# Make film cover

Used for Windows

Windows supports customized folder icon.
Put an image into a folder, such as `cover.jpg`,
pass the folder path to this program,
then it will generate an icon file and a `desktop.ini` file,
which are to change the appearance of the folder.

```text
film
  |-cover.jpg
  |-cover.ico (hidden)
  |-desktop.ini (hidden)
```

This program is originally used to beautify my film collection,
that's why it is named `make-film-cover`.
